# GBM Front-end Developer Challenge

For this challange I created a web application with Angular and Auth0 for the authentication https://auth0.com/docs .
It uses a previously created API of the IPC (√çndice de Precios y Cotizaciones) from https://run.mocky.io/v3/cc4c350b-1f11-42a0-a1aa-f8593eafeb1e .
I implemented a datatable with "Angular Datatables" https://l-lin.github.io/angular-datatables/#/welcome , 
and it has a graph with the data, it was created with Plotly JS https://plotly.com/javascript/ .
And Bootstrap https://getbootstrap.com/
